My interest in technology is what drew me towards studying Computer Science at the University of York and has since extended to my career and personal projects. I have experience as a Software Engineer at Amadeus, who provide IT solutions for the global travel and tourism industry. Since this work is a passion rather than just a career, I have also gained additional experience developing personal projects. I discuss these personal projects and other Computer Science topics here in my blog.

Currently I am in the final year of my Computer Science degree at the University of York and looking for Software Engineer roles. I have full stack web experience and a passion for backend development, data and machine learning. You can contact me via LinkedIn or email, links for both are below the site navigation links.
